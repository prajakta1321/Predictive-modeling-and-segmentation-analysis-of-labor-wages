# Predictive Modeling and Segmentation Analysis of Labor Wages

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing labor wage discrimination through data analysis and machine learning techniques. We identify demographic disparities in wages and propose equity-driven solutions using predictive modeling and segmentation analysis.

## Objectives

- Analyze labor wage data to uncover demographic disparities
- Develop predictive models to understand factors influencing wage differences
- Perform segmentation analysis to identify distinct labor market groups
- Provide data-driven recommendations to reduce wage gaps and promote equity

## Methods and Technologies

- **Data Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, feature engineering, and standardization
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Statistical analysis and data visualization
- **Predictive Analysis**:
  - Linear Regression, K-nearest Neighbours (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for wage prediction
- **Clustering techniques**: for labor market segmentation
- **Performance Metrics**: MSE, RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² for model evaluation

## Key Findings

- Identified significant demographic factors influencing wage disparities
- Developed predictive models with strong accuracy metrics
- Segmented labor market into meaningful clusters revealing wage inequality patterns
- Proposed targeted interventions for specific demographic segments

## Impact

- Enhanced understanding of labor market dynamics through data-driven analysis
- Provided actionable insights for policymakers and organizations
- Developed strategies that could lead to measurable reduction in wage inequality
- Created a framework for ongoing wage equity analysis
